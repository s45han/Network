This is a simulation for network performance when queue is finite and infinite. The program analyzes the performance results using packet loss probability, average delay and queue utilization, idle time, etc. 


How to run the script:

To run simulation for finite queue:           python lab.py finite
To run simulation for inifinite queue:        python lab.py infinite

Finite script will 
 - run simulation for Q3,4 
 - generate finite_En_report.csv ( both E[N] Pidle)

Infinite script will 
 - run simulation for Q6 
 - generate infinite_Ploss_report.csv (E[N]) and combined_En_report.csv (Ploss)
